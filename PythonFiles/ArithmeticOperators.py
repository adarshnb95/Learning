#Until we add a message, type remains as int. The moment we add a string, we need to perform operations separately.

# Comparison operators

a = 3 > 2
print(a) # Will print True as 3 is greater than 2
#Similarly we have >=, <, <=, ==, !=

price = 25
print(price > 10 and price < 30) # And operators can be used for between comparisons.
